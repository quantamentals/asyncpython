Specifications are used by third party developers to implement solutions into a web framework for example


Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI)

WSGI apps are single,synchronous callable that takes in a request and returns a response


Callable is anything that can be called __call__ in python


WGSI is then a python specification for a how a server handles a request. This now provides a universal interface between python apps and web servers


WSGI specifies:

- Must be a callable with request and create_resp_fn parameters
- Must call the create_resp_fn callback before sending the body
- Must return an iterable with pieces / chunks of the document body

Calling the create_resp_fn creates status codes and headers

A bare bones flask server implements the WSGI protocol

def app (request: dict, create_resp_fn):
	create_resp_fn('200 OK', [('Content-Type','text/plain')])
	return ["Hello World!\n"]
