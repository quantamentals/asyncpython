"""

To integrate the custom async logger into a FastAPI application, you can follow these steps:

    Create a logger instance: Create an instance of the AsyncLogger class in your FastAPI application.

Python

from fastapi import FastAPI
from async_logger import AsyncLogger

app = FastAPI()
logger = AsyncLogger('my_logger')

    Start the logger: Start the logger by calling the start method. You can do this in the application's startup event.

Python

from fastapi import FastAPI
from async_logger import AsyncLogger

app = FastAPI()
logger = AsyncLogger('my_logger')

@app.on_event('startup')
async def startup_event():
    await logger.start()

    Use the logger: Use the logger instance to log messages in your application. You can inject the logger instance into your routes or dependencies.

Python

from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends
from async_logger import AsyncLogger

app = FastAPI()
logger = AsyncLogger('my_logger')

@app.on_event('startup')
async def startup_event():
    await logger.start()

@app.get('/')
async def read_root(logger: AsyncLogger = Depends()):
    await logger.log(logging.INFO, 'This is an info message')
    return {'message': 'Hello World'}

    Configure logging: Configure logging settings, such as log level and handlers, using the logging module.

Python

import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

By following these steps, you can integrate the custom async logger into your FastAPI application and log messages asynchronously.
Note: Make sure to adapt the code to your specific use case and requirements. Additionally, consider using a more robust async logging library, such as async-log, for a more comprehensive logging solution.



RedisOM and Redis Pub/Sub can enable log distribution across multiple applications in the following ways:
RedisOM:

    Centralized Log Storage: Use RedisOM to store log messages in a centralized Redis database. Multiple applications can write logs to this database.
    Log Message Publishing: When an application logs a message, RedisOM can publish the message to a Redis Pub/Sub channel.
    Log Message Subscription: Other applications can subscribe to the same Pub/Sub channel to receive log messages.

Redis Pub/Sub:

    Log Message Publishing: Applications can publish log messages to a Redis Pub/Sub channel.
    Log Message Subscription: Other applications can subscribe to the same channel to receive log messages.
    Message Fan-out: Redis Pub/Sub allows for message fan-out, where a single published message can be received by multiple subscribers.

Inter-App Log Distribution:

    App1 logs a message and publishes it to a Redis Pub/Sub channel using RedisOM or Redis Pub/Sub.
    App2 subscribes to the same channel and receives the log message.
    App2 can then process the log message, store it in its own database, or forward it to another application.

Benefits:

    Decoupling: Applications are decoupled from each other, allowing them to operate independently.
    Scalability: Redis Pub/Sub and RedisOM enable scalable log distribution, handling high volumes of log messages.
    Flexibility: Log messages can be processed, stored, or forwarded by receiving applications as needed.

By leveraging RedisOM and Redis Pub/Sub, you can create a distributed logging system that enables log sharing and processing across multiple applications.
