"""
	This is a simple ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) application written in Python. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:
Importing necessary modules

    pprint is used for pretty-printing the scope dictionary.
    uvicorn is an ASGI server that will run the application.

Defining the ASGI application
The app function is the entry point of the ASGI application. It takes three arguments:

    scope: a dictionary containing information about the incoming request.
    receive: an asynchronous function that receives incoming data from the client.
    send: an asynchronous function that sends data back to the client.

Asserting the request type
The assert statement checks that the scope['type'] is equal to 'http', indicating that this is an HTTP request.
Pretty-printing the scope
The pprint.pprint(scope) line pretty-prints the scope dictionary to the console.
Building the response in chunks
The response is built in two chunks:

    Preparing headers and status: The first chunk sends the HTTP response headers and status code (200 OK) using the send function.
    Sending the body: The second chunk sends the response body ("Hello, world!") using the send function.

Running the application
The if __name__ == '__main__': block runs the application using uvicorn. The uvicorn.run function takes several arguments:

    "asgi_implementation:app": the module and application name.
    host='localhost': the host to bind to.
    port=5000: the port to listen on.
    log_level='info': the logging level.

When you run this code, it will start an ASGI server on http://localhost:5000, and you can access it using a web browser or a tool like curl. The response will be "Hello, world!".




Here are common patterns for building a framework on top of ASGI:
1. Request/Response Objects

    Create Request and Response classes to encapsulate data and behavior.
    Request: Parse incoming scope, headers, and body.
    Response: Build response headers, status, and body.

2. Middleware

    Define a middleware interface (e.g., ASGIMiddleware).
    Middlewares can:
        Modify requests/responses.
        Perform authentication/authorization.
        Handle errors.

3. Routing

    Implement a routing system:
        Map URLs to view functions.
        Support route parameters.
        Use a routing table or a decorator-based approach.

4. View Functions

    Define a view function interface (e.g., ASGIView).
    View functions:
        Handle requests.
        Return responses.
        Can use middleware and routing information.

5. Dependency Injection

    Implement dependency injection:
        Provide request-scoped dependencies.
        Use a container or a simple registry.

6. Error Handling

    Catch and handle exceptions:
        Return error responses.
        Log errors.
        Support custom error handlers.

7. Request/Response Streaming

    Support streaming requests and responses:
        Handle chunked encoding.
        Stream large files.

8. WebSocket Support

    Implement WebSocket handling:
        Establish WebSocket connections.
        Handle WebSocket messages.

9. Testing

    Provide testing utilities:
        Mock requests and responses.
        Test middleware and view functions.

10. Extensibility

    Allow framework extensions:
        Plugins or modules.
        Custom middleware and view functions.

Some popular ASGI frameworks that demonstrate these patterns include:

    Starlette
    FastAPI
    Sanic
    Quart

When building your framework, consider the trade-offs between simplicity, flexibility, and performance. You can mix and match these patterns or add your own to create a framework that suits your needs.




Here's a high-level outline of what a trading and order management framework built on top of ASGI could look like:
Framework Name: TradeForge
Core Components:

    Trading Engine:
        Handles order execution, routing, and management.
        Integrates with exchanges, brokers, or other trading systems.
    Order Management System (OMS):
        Manages order lifecycle (creation, modification, cancellation).
        Supports various order types (market, limit, stop-loss, etc.).
    Position Management:
        Tracks and updates trading positions (open, closed, pending).
        Calculates P&L, margin, and risk metrics.
    Risk Management:
        Implements risk checks and limits (position sizing, stop-loss, etc.).
        Monitors and alerts on risk thresholds.
    Market Data:
        Handles real-time market data feeds (quotes, trades, order books).
        Supports data normalization and storage.

ASGI Integration:

    Trade Requests:
        Define ASGI endpoints for sending trade requests (e.g., /trade, /cancel).
        Use ASGI middleware for authentication, rate limiting, and validation.
    WebSockets:
        Establish WebSocket connections for real-time market data and trade updates.
        Use ASGI WebSocket support for bi-directional communication.
    API:
        Provide a RESTful API for querying trading data, positions, and orders.
        Use ASGI routing and middleware for API endpoint management.

Additional Features:

    Strategy Engine:
        Allows users to define and execute trading strategies.
        Supports backtesting and simulation.
    Notification System:
        Sends alerts and notifications for trade executions, errors, and risk events.
    Reporting and Analytics:
        Generates trading performance reports and analytics.
        Supports data visualization and customization.

Example ASGI Endpoints:

    POST /trade: Send a new trade request.
    GET /positions: Retrieve open trading positions.
    WS /marketdata: Establish a WebSocket connection for real-time market data.
    GET /orders: Retrieve a list of pending or executed orders.
    POST /cancel: Cancel an existing trade or order.

Example ASGI Middleware:

    AuthenticationMiddleware: Validates API keys or user credentials.
    RateLimitingMiddleware: Limits the number of requests per minute.
    TradeValidationMiddleware: Checks trade requests for validity and risk compliance.

By building a framework on top of ASGI, you can leverage its performance, scalability, and flexibility to create a robust trading and order management system. TradeForge can be extended and customized to meet specific trading requirements and integrate with various exchanges and data providers.


Here's an updated example of the components and patterns for building TradeForge using only Uvicorn and the ASGI specification:
1. Trading Engine

    OrderExecutor: Handles order execution, routing, and management.
        Pattern: Command-Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)
        Example:

Python

class OrderExecutor:
    async def execute_order(self, scope, order):
        # Route order to exchange or broker
        pass

    async def cancel_order(self, scope, order_id):
        # Cancel order on exchange or broker
        pass

2. Order Management System (OMS)

    OrderManager: Manages order lifecycle.
        Pattern: State Machine
        Example:

Python

class OrderManager:
    async def create_order(self, scope, order):
        # Set order status to "pending"
        pass

    async def update_order(self, scope, order_id, status):
        # Update order status
        pass

    async def cancel_order(self, scope, order_id):
        # Set order status to "cancelled"
        pass

3. Position Management

    PositionManager: Tracks and updates trading positions.
        Pattern: Observer
        Example:

Python

class PositionManager:
    async def update_position(self, scope, position):
        # Notify observers (e.g., risk management)
        pass

    async def get_position(self, scope, symbol):
        # Return current position
        pass

4. Risk Management

    RiskManager: Implements risk checks and limits.
        Pattern: Strategy
        Example:

Python

class RiskManager:
    async def check_position_size(self, scope, position):
        # Calculate position size risk
        pass

    async def check_stop_loss(self, scope, order):
        # Calculate stop-loss risk
        pass

5. Market Data

    MarketDataFeed: Handles real-time market data feeds.
        Pattern: Publisher-Subscriber
        Example:

Python

class MarketDataFeed:
    async def subscribe(self, scope, symbol, callback):
        # Notify callback with market data updates
        pass

    async def unsubscribe(self, scope, symbol):
        # Remove subscription
        pass

ASGI Application

    TradeApp: Defines the ASGI application.
        Example:

Python

async def trade_app(scope, receive, send):
    if scope["type"] == "http":
        # Handle HTTP requests
        if scope["method"] == "POST" and scope["path"] == "/trade":
            # Execute trade using Trading Engine
            pass
        elif scope["method"] == "GET" and scope["path"] == "/positions":
            # Return positions using Position Manager
            pass
    elif scope["type"] == "websocket":
        # Handle WebSocket connections
        pass

Uvicorn Server

    Run the ASGI application using Uvicorn.
        Example:

Python

if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run("trade_app:trade_app", host="localhost", port=5000)

This example demonstrates how to build TradeForge using Uvicorn and the ASGI specification, without relying on FastAPI. You can expand and refine these components and patterns to meet specific trading requirements.



To build a more efficient router or event handler, consider using the following patterns or switch-like constructs:

    Dictionary Mapping:

Python

routes = {
    ("http", "POST", "/trade"): handle_trade,
    ("http", "GET", "/positions"): handle_positions,
    ("websocket", None, None): handle_websocket,
}

async def trade_app(scope, receive, send):
    handler = routes.get((scope["type"], scope["method"], scope["path"]))
    if handler:
        await handler(scope, receive, send)

    Tuple Matching:

Python

async def trade_app(scope, receive, send):
    match (scope["type"], scope["method"], scope["path"]):
        case ("http", "POST", "/trade"):
            await handle_trade(scope, receive, send)
        case ("http", "GET", "/positions"):
            await handle_positions(scope, receive, send)
        case ("websocket", _, _):
            await handle_websocket(scope, receive, send)

    Chain of Responsibility:

Python

class Handler:
    def __init__(self, next_handler=None):
        self.next_handler = next_handler

    async def handle(self, scope, receive, send):
        pass

class HttpTradeHandler(Handler):
    async def handle(self, scope, receive, send):
        if scope["type"] == "http" and scope["method"] == "POST" and scope["path"] == "/trade":
            await handle_trade(scope, receive, send)
        elif self.next_handler:
            await self.next_handler.handle(scope, receive, send)

class WebSocketHandler(Handler):
    async def handle(self, scope, receive, send):
        if scope["type"] == "websocket":
            await handle_websocket(scope, receive, send)
        elif self.next_handler:
            await self.next_handler.handle(scope, receive, send)

async def trade_app(scope, receive, send):
    handler = HttpTradeHandler(next_handler=WebSocketHandler())
    await handler.handle(scope, receive, send)

    Event-Driven Architecture:

Python

class EventBus:
    def __init__(self):
        self.handlers = {}

    def register(self, event_type, handler):
        self.handlers.setdefault(event_type, []).append(handler)

    async def publish(self, event_type, scope, receive, send):
        for handler in self.handlers.get(event_type, []):
            await handler(scope, receive, send)

bus = EventBus()
bus.register("http_trade", handle_trade)
bus.register("websocket_connect", handle_websocket)

async def trade_app(scope, receive, send):
    await bus.publish(scope["type"], scope, receive, send)

These patterns and constructs allow for more efficient and scalable routing or event handling logic in your ASGI application. Choose the one that best fits your needs.

## Trade example:

Here's an example of how you can extend the base code to create a trade and order execution engine using pure Python and Uvicorn with asyncio:
Python

import asyncio
import uvicorn
import pprint

class Order:
    def __init__(self, instrument, order_type, quantity, price):
        self.instrument = instrument
        self.order_type = order_type
        self.quantity = quantity
        self.price = price

class Trade:
    def __init__(self, order_id, instrument, quantity, price, timestamp):
        self.order_id = order_id
        self.instrument = instrument
        self.quantity = quantity
        self.price = price
        self.timestamp = timestamp

orders = {}
trades = []

async def create_order(instrument, order_type, quantity, price):
    order_id = len(orders) + 1
    orders[order_id] = Order(instrument, order_type, quantity, price)
    return order_id

async def execute_trade(order_id):
    order = orders.get(order_id)
    if order:
        trade = Trade(
            order_id=order_id,
            instrument=order.instrument,
            quantity=order.quantity,
            price=order.price,
            timestamp=asyncio.datetime.now()
        )
        trades.append(trade)
        return trade
    return None

async def app(scope, receive, send):
    assert scope['type'] == 'http'

    # Create a new order
    order_id = await create_order('AAPL', 'limit', 100, 150.0)
    pprint.pprint(orders)

    # Execute the trade
    trade = await execute_trade(order_id)
    pprint.pprint(trades)

    # Send the response
    await send({
        'type': 'http.response.start',
        'status': 200,
        'headers': [
            [b'content-type', b'text/plain']
        ]
    })
    await send({
        'type': 'http.response.body',
        'body': b'Trade executed!'
    })

if __name__ == '__main__':
    uvicorn.run("asgi_implementation:app", host='localhost', port=5000, log_level='info')

In this example, we've added two new asynchronous functions:

    create_order: creates a new order and returns the order ID
    execute_trade: executes a trade based on the order ID and returns the trade object

We've also modified the app function to create a new order and execute a trade using these new functions.
Note that we're using asyncio.datetime.now() to get the current timestamp, which is an asynchronous-friendly way to get the current time.
You can run this code using Uvicorn and access it using a web browser or a tool like curl. The response will be "Trade executed!".
"""


"""
To run a simple task handler loop as a background process to listen for new orders and execute them asynchronously, you can use the asyncio.create_task function to create a task that runs the loop, and then use uvicorn to run the ASGI application.
Here's an example:
Python

import asyncio
import uvicorn

# Define the task handler loop
async def task_handler_loop():
    while True:
        # Check for new orders
        new_orders = await check_for_new_orders()
        
        # Execute new orders
        for order in new_orders:
            await execute_order(order)
        
        # Wait for 1 second before checking again
        await asyncio.sleep(1)

# Define the check_for_new_orders function
async def check_for_new_orders():
    # Replace with your own logic to check for new orders
    return [Order(instrument='AAPL', order_type='limit', quantity=100, price=150.0)]

# Define the execute_order function
async def execute_order(order):
    # Replace with your own logic to execute the order
    print(f'Executing order: {order.instrument}')

# Create the task handler loop task
task = asyncio.create_task(task_handler_loop())

# Run the ASGI application
if __name__ == '__main__':
    uvicorn.run("asgi_implementation:app", host='localhost', port=5000, log_level='info')

In this example, the task_handler_loop function is defined to check for new orders every second and execute them asynchronously. The asyncio.create_task function is used to create a task that runs this loop.
The check_for_new_orders function is a placeholder for your own logic to check for new orders, and the execute_order function is a placeholder for your own logic to execute the order.
When you run this code, the task handler loop will run in the background, checking for new orders and executing them asynchronously, while the ASGI application runs concurrently.
Note that you'll need to replace the check_for_new_orders and execute_order functions with your own logic to integrate with your order management system.

To structure your code effectively, consider the following suggestions:

    Separate concerns:
        Create separate modules or files for:
            Order management (e.g., orders.py)
            Trade execution (e.g., trades.py)
            Task handler loop (e.g., task_handler.py)
            ASGI application (e.g., app.py)
    Use classes and objects:
        Define classes for:
            Orders (e.g., Order class in orders.py)
            Trades (e.g., Trade class in trades.py)
        Use objects to represent orders and trades
    Abstract away implementation details:
        Use interfaces or abstract classes to define:
            Order management interface (e.g., OrderManager in orders.py)
            Trade execution interface (e.g., TradeExecutor in trades.py)
        Implement concrete classes for each interface
    Use dependency injection:
        Pass dependencies (e.g., OrderManager, TradeExecutor) to the task handler loop and ASGI application
        Use a dependency injection framework (e.g., inject) or a simple factory function
    Keep the task handler loop simple:
        Focus on coordinating tasks, not implementing business logic
        Use the interfaces and abstract classes to interact with order management and trade execution
    Use logging and monitoring:
        Log important events and errors
        Use a monitoring tool (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track performance and errors




To implement background tasks in an ASGI app, consider the following approaches:

    ASGI Lifespan: Utilize the startup and shutdown events to run background tasks.

Python

async def startup():
    # Start background tasks
    pass

async def shutdown():
    # Stop background tasks
    pass

async def trade_app(scope, receive, send):
    # ...

    Background Tasks with asyncio:

Python

import asyncio

async def background_task():
    # Run background task
    pass

async def trade_app(scope, receive, send):
    # Create a background task
    task = asyncio.create_task(background_task())
    try:
        # Handle request
        pass
    finally:
        # Cancel background task
        task.cancel()

    Celery: Integrate Celery, a distributed task queue, to run background tasks.

Python

from celery import Celery

celery = Celery()

@celery.task
def background_task():
    # Run background task
    pass

async def trade_app(scope, receive, send):
    # Trigger background task
    celery.send_task("background_task")
    # Handle request
    pass

    Quart's Background Tasks: If using Quart, utilize its built-in background task support.

Python

from quart import Quart, BackgroundTask

app = Quart()

@app.before_serving
async def startup():
    # Start background tasks
    pass

@app.after_serving
async def shutdown():
    # Stop background tasks
    pass

@app.route("/")
async def index():
    # Trigger background task
    await BackgroundTask(background_task)
    return "OK"

    Uvicorn's Workers: Utilize Uvicorn's worker support to run background tasks.

Python

if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run("trade_app:trade_app", host="localhost", port=5000, workers=3)

In this example, Uvicorn will run three worker processes, allowing you to run background tasks concurrently.
Choose the approach that best fits your needs, considering factors like task complexity, concurrency, and scalability.


Here's an example directory structure:
Bash

project/
app.py
orders/
__init__.py
order.py
order_manager.py
trades/
__init__.py
trade.py
trade_executor.py
task_handler.py
utils/
__init__.py
dependencies.py
logging.py
requirements.txt

Remember to keep your code organized, readable, and maintainable. As your project grows, you may need to adjust the structure to accommodate new requirements.


Here's an example of the new app.py file, composed of dummy components:
Python

import asyncio
from uvicorn import run
from orders.order_manager import OrderManager
from trades.trade_executor import TradeExecutor
from task_handler.task_handler import TaskHandler
from utils.dependencies import Dependencies

app = Dependencies()

# Initialize order manager
order_manager = OrderManager()

# Initialize trade executor
trade_executor = TradeExecutor()

# Initialize task handler
task_handler = TaskHandler(order_manager, trade_executor)

async def app(scope, receive, send):
    # Handle incoming requests
    await task_handler.handle_request(scope, receive, send)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Run the ASGI application
    run("app:app", host='localhost', port=5000, log_level='info')

    # Run the task handler loop in the background
    asyncio.create_task(task_handler.run())

In this example, we've:

    Imported the necessary components:
        OrderManager from orders.order_manager
        TradeExecutor from trades.trade_executor
        TaskHandler from task_handler.task_handler
        Dependencies from utils.dependencies
    Initialized the order manager, trade executor, and task handler
    Defined the app function, which handles incoming requests and passes them to the task handler
    Run the ASGI application using uvicorn
    Run the task handler loop in the background using asyncio.create_task

Note that this is just a dummy example, and you'll need to replace the components with your own implementation.



To run a bare Uvicorn server with SSL support without using a framework like FastAPI or Starlette, follow these steps:

    Generate SSL certificates:

Create a private key (ssl_key.pem) and a self-signed certificate (ssl_cert.pem) using tools like OpenSSL:
Bash

openssl genrsa -out ssl_key.pem 2048
openssl req -new -x509 -key ssl_key.pem -out ssl_cert.pem -days 365

    Create an ASGI application:

Define a simple ASGI application that handles HTTPS requests:
Python

async def app(scope, receive, send):
    if scope["type"] == "http":
        await send({
            "type": "http.response.start",
            "status": 200,
            "headers": [(b"content-type", b"text/plain")],
        })
        await send({"type": "http.response.body", "body": b"Hello, World!"})

    Run Uvicorn with SSL:

Use the --ssl-keyfile and --ssl-certfile options to specify the SSL certificates:
Bash

uvicorn --host 0.0.0.0 --port 443 --ssl-keyfile ssl_key.pem --ssl-certfile ssl_cert.pem app:app

Replace app:app with the module and application name.

    Access the server:

Open a web browser and navigate to https://localhost:443. You should see the "Hello, World!" response.
Note:

    Self-signed certificates will trigger browser warnings. For production, obtain a trusted SSL certificate.
    Ensure the ssl_key.pem and ssl_cert.pem files are readable by the Uvicorn process.

By following these steps, you'll have a bare Uvicorn server running with SSL support, handling HTTPS requests without relying on a framework.

#

Here are some additional security and socket-level techniques possible:
Security Techniques:

    TLS/SSL Certificate Pinning: Verify the server's identity by checking its certificate against a known good copy.

#

Here are some simple toy examples for the techniques I mentioned earlier:
Security Techniques:

    TLS/SSL Certificate Pinning:

Python

import ssl

context = ssl.create_default_context()
context.load_verify_locations("path/to/cert.pem")
context.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_REQUIRED

async def app(scope, receive, send):
    # ...

    Client Certificate Authentication:

Python

import ssl

context = ssl.create_default_context()
context.load_verify_locations("path/to/cert.pem")
context.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_REQUIRED
context.require_certificate = True

async def app(scope, receive, send):
    # ...

Socket-Level Techniques:

    TCP Keepalive:

Python

import socket

async def app(scope, receive, send):
    sock = scope["socket"]
    sock.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_KEEPALIVE, 1)
    # ...

    SO_REUSEADDR:

Python

import socket

async def app(scope, receive, send):
    sock = scope["socket"]
    sock.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
    # ...

ASGI-Specific Techniques:

    ASGI HTTPS:

Python

import uvicorn

async def app(scope, receive, send):
    # ...

uvicorn.run(app, host="localhost", port=443, ssl_keyfile="path/to/key.pem", ssl_certfile="path/to/cert.pem")

    ASGI WebSockets:

Python

import uvicorn

async def app(scope, receive, send):
    if scope["type"] == "websocket":
        # Handle WebSocket connection
        pass

uvicorn.run(app, host="localhost", port=443, ssl_keyfile="path/to/key.pem", ssl_certfile="path/to/cert.pem")

These examples demonstrate basic implementations of various security and socket-level techniques. Note that these are simplified examples and may require additional configuration and error handling for production use.

Uvicorn and ASGI can work with raw sockets directly using the uvicorn.protocols.utils module and the asgi protocol. Here's an example:
Raw Socket Example
Python

import socket
import uvicorn
from uvicorn.protocols.utils import get_logger
from asgi import Scope, Message

# Create a raw socket
sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
sock.bind(("localhost", 8080))
sock.listen(1)

# Define an ASGI application
async def app(scope: Scope, receive: Message, send: Message):
    # Handle incoming data
    data = await receive()
    await send({"type": "http.response.start", "status": 200})
    await send({"type": "http.response.body", "body": data})

# Create a Uvicorn server
server = uvicorn.Server(

        port=8080,
        log_level="info",
    ),
    sockets=[sock],
)

        log_level="info",
    ),

Uvicorn uses sockets to handle incoming requests and send responses. Here's a high-level overview of how Uvicorn manages sockets:
Socket Creation

    Uvicorn creates a listening socket using the socket module.
    The listening socket is bound to a specific address and port.

Socket Acceptance

    When a new connection is established, Uvicorn accepts the socket using accept().
    A new socket object is created for the accepted connection.

Socket Handling

    Uvicorn uses the select module to manage multiple sockets simultaneously.
    The select module allows Uvicorn to wait for incoming data on multiple sockets.
    When data is available on a socket, Uvicorn reads the data using recv().
    The data is then processed by the ASGI application.

Socket Sending

    Uvicorn sends responses back to the client using sendall().
    The response data is written to the socket.

Socket Closure

    When a connection is closed, Uvicorn closes the socket using close().

To build Uvicorn from base sockets, you can follow these steps:
Step 1: Create a listening socket
Python

import socket

listen_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
listen_socket.bind(("localhost", 8080))
listen_socket.listen(1)

Step 2: Accept incoming connections
Python

client_socket, address = listen_socket.accept()

Step 3: Handle incoming data
Python

data = client_socket.recv(1024)
# Process data using ASGI application

Step 4: Send response
Python

response = b"Hello, World!"
client_socket.sendall(response)

Step 5: Close socket
Python

client_socket.close()

Step 6: Repeat steps 2-5 for multiple connections
Python

while True:
    client_socket, address = listen_socket.accept()
    # Handle incoming data and send response

This is a basic example of how Uvicorn manages sockets. Uvicorn's actual implementation is more complex, handling multiple sockets, timeouts, and errors.
To build a full-featured Uvicorn-like server, consider using libraries like:

    select or epoll for socket management
    asyncio for asynchronous I/O
    asgi for ASGI application support

Keep in mind that building a production-ready server requires handling various edge cases, errors, and performance optimizations.

Uvicorn performs several tasks beyond creating and managing sockets:

    httptools: Uvicorn employs httptools, a Python library for parsing HTTP requests and responses.
    WebSockets: Uvicorn supports WebSockets, enabling bidirectional communication between clients and servers.
    SSL/TLS: Uvicorn provides SSL/TLS encryption for secure communication.
    Python 3.7+: Uvicorn requires Python 3.7 or later, leveraging features like asyncio, async/await, and type hints.
    Cython: Uvicorn uses Cython to optimize performance-critical components.
    Event-driven architecture: Uvicorn's design is based on an event-driven architecture, allowing efficient handling of concurrent requests.
    Coroutines: Uvicorn utilizes coroutines to manage asynchronous tasks, reducing overhead and improving performance.
    Socket programming: Uvicorn performs low-level socket programming for efficient network communication.
    HTTP/2: Uvicorn supports HTTP/2, enabling multiplexing, header compression, and improved performance.
    Python's async/await syntax: Uvicorn leverages Python's async/await syntax for readable and maintainable asynchronous code.

These technologies and concepts combined enable Uvicorn's high performance, scalability, and flexibility.
